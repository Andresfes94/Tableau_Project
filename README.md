# Project: Business Intelligence with Tableau

## Overview
The goal of this project is  to practice all learned in the Business Intelligence chapter of this program. We selected a data base 
 from a ficticious company.
 We explore the data using SQL+Tableau, and put together a Story 
for presentation showing the insights you have derived from the data.

## Project Description
The idea with this project was attempt to get  insides from the data
of this company concerning to the well-known Salary gap between female 
and male workers around the globe. 

Therefore we explore the data base using MySQl looking to retrieve right and 
meaningful data, then we export it to Tableau for visualization. 
In our approach to check if in this company there is any gap in the salaries
of the employees first we need to know how many employees of each gender
are working at the company. 

We also check the number of female employees in executive positions during 
a period of time in the company, for this analysis we limited our search to 
the period 1990-2002. Making use of the Salary table we computed the average 
salary of the employees per department.
